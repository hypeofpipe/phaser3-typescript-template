# Phaser 3 Typescript Project Template

A Phaser 3 project template with Typescript support.

DISCLAIMER: There is currently no typing support for Phaser 3. Since the Phaser 3 API is still undergoing breaking changes, I doubt there will be for some time. For this reason tsc will throw errors due to Phaser not being defined.

### Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

## Install and run

Run next commands in your terminal:

| Command              | Description                                            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npm install`        | Install dependencies and launch browser with examples. |
| `npm start`          | Build app and launch browser                           |
| `npm run production` | Build app with minification enabled                    |
| `npm run type-check` | Runs tsc                                               |
